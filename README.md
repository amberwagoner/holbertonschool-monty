# 0x19.C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO/FIFO

## Learning Objectives
- What do LIFO and FIFO mean
- What is a stack and when to use it
- What is a queue and when to use it
- What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
- What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- What is the proper way to use global variables

## The Monty Language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the `.m` extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line.
